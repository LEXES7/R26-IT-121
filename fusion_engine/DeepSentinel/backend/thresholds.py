"""The operating point the monitor actually alerts on.

The threshold page replays stored decisions at a different line, which is real
measurement — genuine scores against genuine labels. But a page that can only
measure is a calculator, not a control: an operator can conclude the line
should move and then has nowhere to move it.

So the chosen fused line is persisted here and the monitor prefers it over the
model's own defaults. Setting it changes which transactions raise an alert.

Only the fused verdict is settable. Each detector's internal threshold belongs
to that detector's service — the relational model already publishes its bands
on /health and the monitor reads them — so overriding those here would mean
this file quietly disagreeing with the model that owns them.
