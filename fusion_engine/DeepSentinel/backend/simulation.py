"""Replaying historical decisions at a different threshold.

The question an operator actually asks is not "what is our F1" but "if I move
the line, how many more alerts land on my desk tomorrow, and how many real cases
do I miss?" This answers that from what the system has already scored.

Why this is only meaningful because the scores are calibrated
------------------------------------------------------------
Sliding a threshold over raw model output tells you nothing transferable — the
number has no fixed meaning between models or over time. Isotonic calibration
brought expected calibration error from 0.80 to 0.024, so a threshold of 0.4 is
"40% likely to be fraud" rather than an arbitrary cut point. The slider is the
commercial expression of that work.

What this is not
----------------
A prediction. It replays decisions already made on transactions already seen,
so it says what *would have* happened, not what *will*. Alert volume shifts with
traffic; the response says how many records the estimate rests on so nobody
reads a confident number off twelve rows.
