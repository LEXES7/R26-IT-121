"""The always-on monitoring loop.

Every transaction goes to all three detectors at once:

                        ┌──▶ GraphSAGE   (structure)  ──┐
    every transaction ──┼──▶ Behaviour   (VAE)        ──┼──▶ fusion ──▶ alert
                        └──▶ Timing      (TCN)        ──┘

This used to be a cascade, with the graph model gating the other two, and the
docstring here described that design long after the code stopped doing it. The
cascade was measured against a 400-transaction replay and it cost half the
frauds: four of the eight it missed scored 0.011–0.107 on the graph model, far
below the gate, while the behavioural model scored those same four between 0.51
and 1.00. A gate in front of an independent detector cannot beat that detector;
it can only hide it. It bought no speed either — the calls were sequential
awaits, so a flagged transaction paid all three in series. Fanned out they cost
whichever one is slowest, once.

A detector that cannot answer **abstains**: its score is excluded from the
fusion rather than counted as low, and the fused confidence is shrunk toward
uncertainty. Absence is not innocence.

Two alerts leave the system for one incident, on purpose:

  * **Early warning**, the moment the graph model trips. Fast and provisional —
    an analyst can start looking while the narrative is still being written.
  * **Confirmed alert**, after fusion, carrying the severity band and the
    forensic report.

Neither the report nor the mail is awaited by the pipeline. Both are slow and
neither changes the verdict; charging them to screening latency once made the
case table report how slow Gmail was as though it were detection time.
