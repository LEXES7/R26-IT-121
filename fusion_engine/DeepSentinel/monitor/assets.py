"""Images embedded in the alert email.

Attached as CID parts rather than linked. Remote images are blocked by
default in most inboxes, so a hosted banner would show as a broken box in
exactly the message that most needs to be read at a glance.

Read once and cached: an alert is sent per case, and re-reading four files
from disk each time buys nothing.

Every lookup returns None rather than raising when a file is absent. An
alert that arrives without its banner is a cosmetic loss; an alert that does
not arrive because a JPEG was missing is a real one.
