"""Recording what the models caught, and why.

`fraud_cases` is the table a stakeholder reads. For one alert it holds: what
each model scored and whether it answered at all, the matched typology, the
graph's structural evidence and the behavioural detector's attribution, how
long it took, who was told, and what a human decided afterwards.

The evidence columns are the difference between a case a reviewer can act on
and a row of numbers. A score says a transaction was unusual; the attribution
says which feature and which latent dimension made it unusual, which is the
question the reviewer actually has.

Two things are recorded that are easy to leave out and matter later:

  * **whether each model was available.** A confidence built from one detector
    is not the same claim as one built from three. Without this the number is
    uninterpretable six months on.
  * **the ground-truth label, when the source file carried one.** Kept so
    precision can be measured after the fact — never shown as a model output.

Writing a case must never break the alert that produced it, so every failure
here is logged and swallowed.
